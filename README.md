# Debian/Ubuntu build and testing containers
This repository provides some scripts and a Docker setup to build Debian/Ubuntu packages out of the other perfSONAR source repositories.

This directoy needs to be at the same level as the other perfSONAR repositories that you want to build. The checked-out branch of the source repo will be built.  You'll also need the [distribution](https://github.com/perfsonar/distribution/) perfSONAR repository cloned at the same level as the source repositories, the setup currently uses the 5.0.0 branch of this distribution repository.

These scripts rely heavily on Docker and a working `docker buildx` setup.

## Build packages
To build a Debian/Ubuntu package, run something like:

./build-in-docker toolkit

* args understood (full list in script itself):
  * `-d` don't rebuild Docker images but use locally existing one
  * `-B` don't rebuild source package but use previously build one
  * `-D` debug build, will get you into a shell instead of doing the build
  * `-k` use and keep locally built packages (can be useful to solve build dependencies)
  * `-s` build only the source package

The resulting packages will be located in a new directory at the same level as the other repositories called `build_results`

The build will use the information from the `debian/gbp.conf` file to know on which distro the package should be built and with which perfSONAR repository the dependencies should be solved.

Once you have the `docker buildx` images ready, you can call all subsequent builds with `-d`.

There is provision to use a HTTP proxy to download packages if you need to do so.  See the examples below and in the scripts.

### Examples

* Building `perfsonar-graphs` located in the `../graphs` directory:
```
./build-in-docker graphs
```
* Building `perfsonar-graphs` a second time:
```
./build-in-docker -d graphs
```
* Building `perfsonar-graphs` to debug the binary build and keep the previously localy built packages:
```
./build-in-docker -dBD -k graphs
```
* Building `pscheduler-archiver-rabbitmq` using a local proxy:
```
proxy=172.17.0.1:3128 package=pscheduler-archiver-rabbitmq ./build-in-docker pscheduler
```

## Test packages
To test the installation of a resulting package, run something like:

./test-in-docker package.deb

This project provides ways of testing installation of perfSONAR DEB package-based bundles on Debian-based systems using Docker containers.

Fully Supported:
 * Debian 9 Stretch
 * Debian 10 Buster
 * Ubuntu 16 Xenial Xerus
 * Ubuntu 18 Bionic Beaver

You can run the tests by executing `test_install_instructions.sh $REPO $OS $BUNDLE` (with all args optional but the previous one always required) where:

 * `$REPO` is one of these (default is to use production):
   * `perfsonar-release` (production)
   * `perfsonar-patch-snapshot`
   * `perfsonar-minor-snapshot`
   * `perfsonar-patch-staging`
 * `$OS` is one of these (default to test all):
   * `debian:stretch`
   * `debian:buster`
   * `ubuntu:xenial`
   * `ubuntu:bionic`
