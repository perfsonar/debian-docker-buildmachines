# If you want to build for all architectures, you can pass 'full_build' as arg
# Or 'dual_build' to build only for AMD64 and ARM64
# See docker-bake.hcl for details and other bake targets

### Check current status

### Clear Docker caches
echo -e "\033[1mLet's clear caches\033[0m"

### Create and setup the buildx instance for the multi arch builds
# See https://docs.docker.com/desktop/multi-arch/

# It uses the images from https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static
# Also see https://medium.com/@artur.klauser/building-multi-architecture-docker-images-with-buildx-27d80f7e2408 for more context
# This should only be needed once per Docker daemon run, but it shouldn't be a problem running it everytime we run the setup
# Docker Desktop should have it right out of the box, but not a problem adding it too.
