    Usage: ${0##*/} [-o OSname]
    This script will build the package from the current repository using Unibuild.
    Requirements:
        - The source branch to build from need to be checked out
        - Functionnal docker buildx setup
        - Needs at least 2 sudoers whitelisting to be able to run under Jenkins.

    Defaults values:
        - Support OS dependants builds on D10 and U20 (only packages needed to be compiled specifically
          on these OS are going to be tailored built.
        - Solves build and installation dependencies from the perfsonar-minor-snapshot repository
        - Build on all 4 arches we support for Debian and Ubuntu: amd64, arm64, armhf and ppc64el
        - Use the docker-compose-unibuild.yml setup from the docker-debian-buildmachines repo
        - Build the current directory

    Arguments understood:
        -o OS to build on (defaults to u18, the oldes OS we support), needs to be in lower case
           short form like d11 or u22

    Environment variables that can be set:
        - limit the number of arches built, ex: ARCHES='linux/arm64 linux/amd64'
        - build for a different set of other OSes: OSes="d11 u22"
        - use a different pS repository to solve dependencies: REPO="perfsonar-5.0-staging"
        - use a different Docker compose file: COMPOSE_FILE="path/to/compose-file.yml"
        - build a given directory: DIR_TO_BE_BUILT="/full/path/dir/to/be/built"
        - some Unibuild options: UNIBUILD_OPTS
          
    Some examples:
    ../debian-docker-buildmachines/build-with-unibuild
    ARCHES='linux/arm64 linux/amd64' ../debian-docker-buildmachines/build-with-unibuild
